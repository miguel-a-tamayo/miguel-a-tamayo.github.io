            The objective of this project is to introduce the Arduino microcontroller its ability
            to read inputs and turn them into useful outputs. The input data will come from three
            buttons which will manipulate a timer. The output is then displayed through a 7-segment
            4 digit display by using bit shifting to turn on the different segments and digits in a
            pattern.
        </p>

            The outcome of the project is to demonstrate a working timer that allows the user to
            set the preferred time by using two buttons and start a count-down sequence once the
            start button pressed.
