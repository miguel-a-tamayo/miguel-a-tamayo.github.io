            <h2>Project Overview</h2>

            <p>
                The objective of this project is to introduce the Arduino microcontroller its ability
                to read inputs and turn them into useful outputs. The input data will come from three
                buttons which will manipulate a timer. The output is then displayed through a 7-segment
                4 digit display by using bit shifting to turn on the different segments and digits in a
                pattern.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The outcome of the project is to demonstrate a working timer that allows the user to
                set the preferred time by using two buttons and start a count-down sequence once the
                start button pressed.
            </p>

            The components needed for this project are:
            <ul>
                <li>Breadboard</li>
                <li>Arduino Nano</li>
                <li>Button (x3)</li>
                <li>Resistor: 10K&Omega;</li>
                <li>7-Segment 4 Digit Display</li>
                <li>Wired</li>
            </ul>

            The software products used in the project are:
            <ul>
                <li>Arduino IDE</li>
                <li>KiCad</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Note: The 7-Segment 4 Digit display used is active low. If an active high display
                is used, the code must be changed in order to successfully turn on the segments in the
                display. This is covered in the software section.
