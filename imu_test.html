    <p>
        An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device usually containing an accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope.
        These elements obtain the acceleration, magnetic field around the device, and angular rate. By combining this
        information, we can determine the orientation of the device which it is attached to.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project focuses on understanding how to use the Adafruit BNO055 9 degrees of
        freedom sensor through a series of actions. First, the sensor must be calibrated in order
        to get accurate data. After calibration, the orientation of the device will be displayed
        and used to rotate an object in a simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The outcome expected of this project is to successfully send the data from the BNO055
        sensor through serial communication to a simulator with a space shuttle which will rotate
        based on the orientation of the sensor.
